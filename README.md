Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid snowboarder. During the warmer months here in Boston, I enjoy hiking, biking trails and traveling to other states and countries.

When forced indoors, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.
